A bit is one electric pulse, for example, 5 volt is 1, 0 volt is 0.

8 bits together will present some value.

For example, 

'#' is represented as `10101010`

The plus instruction is `10000011`

Assembly lanuage contains code instructions and **OS level calls**. These vary depending on the platform (processor + OS).

So in order for your program to work on different platforms, you need corresponding compilers. It can be expensive.



Here comes Java.
