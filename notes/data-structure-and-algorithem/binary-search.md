Binary search is one of the examples of _Divide and conquor_

Every time it tries to halve the data.

This can be represented by logarithm (base 2).

> Logarithm mirrors exponentiation, which double the base every time it grows.
> so logarithem haleves the base every time it shrinks.

So search a record in a dataset of 200,000, can be definitly found after 17 or 18 operations.

because log<sub>2</sub><sup>200,000</sup> = 17.61
