https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html

A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.

Concretely, **a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.**

```
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
```

Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.
