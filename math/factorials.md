## Fundamental Counting Principle

A rule used to count the total number of possible outcomes in a situation. It states that if there are n ways of doing something, and m ways of doing another thing after that, then there are n×m ways to perform both of these actions. In other words, when choosing an option for n **and** an option for m, there are n×m different ways to do both actions. 

### Example 1

There are 888 daily newspapers and 555 weekly magazines published in Chicago. If Colin wants to subscribe to  exactly one daily newspaper and one weekly magazine, how many different  choices does he have?

Colin has 8×5=40 choices.

### Example 2

Calvin wants to go to Milwaukee. He can choose from 3 bus services or 2 train services to head from home to downtown Chicago. From there, he  can choose from 2 bus services or 3 train services to head to Milwaukee. How many ways are there for him to get to Milwaukee?

Since Calvin can either take a bus or a train downtown , he has 3+2=5 ways to head downtown (Rule of sum). After which, he can either take a bus or a train to Milwaukee, and hence he has another 2+3=5 ways to head to Milwaukee (Rule of sum). Thus in total, he has 5×5=25 ways to head from home to Milwaukee (Rule of product).

### Example 3

Six friends Andy, Bandy, Candy, Dandy, Endy, and Fandy want to sit in a  row at the cinema. If there are only six seats available, how many ways  can we seat these friends?

For the first seat, we have a choice of any of the 6 friends. After seating the first person, for the second seat, we have a choice of any  of the remaining 5 friends. After seating the second person, for the  third seat, we have a choice of any of the remaining 4 friends. After  seating the third person, for the fourth seat, we have a choice of any  of the remaining 3 friends. After seating the fourth person, for the  fifth seat, we have a choice of any of the remaining 2 friends. After  seating the fifth person, for the sixth seat, we have a choice of only 1 of the remaining friends.  Hence, by the rule of product, there are 6×5×4×3×2×1=720 ways to seat these 6 people. More generally, this problem is known as a [permutation](https://brilliant.org/wiki/permutations/). There are n!=n×(n−1)×(n−2)×⋯×1 ways to seat n people in a row.
