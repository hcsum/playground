## IPv4

4 means 8 bits + 8 bits + 8 bits + 8 bits = 32 bits

e.g. 192.168.1.100

192 is one of the 8 bits, which in binary is 1100 0000

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |

so any IPv4 IP has range from 0~255.0~255.0~255.0~255

## IPv6

Hexadecimal (16 进制)

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

MAC address and IPv6 both use Hexadecimal values

MAC (media access control) address is unique in every device.
