## Operating System

_Linux_ is only the kernel of the operating system.

OS is also consist of **important system libraries** and **important system services** (daemons)

The default shell for Linux: bash (Bourne Again Shell)

The Linux Foundation: OSDL merged with the Free Standards Group in 2007 to form The Linux Foundation, with a base mission to promote, protect, improve and standardize Linux.

#### Linux vs UNIX

Linux has its roots in UNIX. As such, some of its most basic components are completely rooted in UNIX: inode-based filesystem, multi-process scheduling, process creation and destruction, accessing hardware though device nodes, etc.

The 3 major Linux distribution families are: Red Hat, Debian, and SUSE.

## Bash

```bash
# see all the shells available in the system
cat /etc/shells
```
