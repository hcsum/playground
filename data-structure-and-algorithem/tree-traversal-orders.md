## In-order Traversal
In this traversal method, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right sub-tree. We should always remember that every node may represent a subtree itself.

## Pre-order Traversal
In this traversal method, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree and finally the right subtree.

## Post-order Traversal
In this traversal method, the root node is visited last, hence the name. First we traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree and finally the root node.
