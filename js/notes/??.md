The **nullish coalescing operator (`??`)** is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is [`null`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null) or [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined), and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.

Contrary to [the logical OR (`||`) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR), the left operand is returned if it is a _[falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators#Description)_ value which is not `null` or `undefined`. In other words, if you use `||` to provide some default value to another variable `foo`, you may encounter unexpected behaviors if you consider some falsy values as usable (eg. `''` or `0`). See below for more examples.

```js
const foo = null || 42;
console.log(foo);
// expected output: 42, works fine with null

const bar = 0 || 42;
console.log(bar);
// expected output: 42, oops, bug if you want 0 to be default value

const baz = 0 ?? 42;
console.log(baz);
// expected output: 0, works, now 0 is the default value
```
