/**
Higher-order Functions
Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions. Either by receiving them as arguments or returning them as values. In the previous example, we can say that greetWorld is a higher-order function, because it expects a function as an input argument.

In JavaScript itself, there are a lot of places where we have higher-order functions. The Array.prototype methods are great examples. They receive a callback function that is invoked on all the elements of the array object.
